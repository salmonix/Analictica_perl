Perl6::Role - Perl6 roles in Perl5

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Some::Role;
  
  # to make the package a role, 
  # just inherit from Perl6::Roles
  use base 'Perl6::Roles'; 

  sub foo { ... }
  sub foobar { ... }

  package Some::Other::Role;

  use base 'Perl6::Roles';

  sub bar { ... }

  package Your::Class;

  use Some::Role;
  Some::Role->apply( __PACKAGE__ );
  # or ...
  Some::Role->apply( 'Some::Class' ); 

  sub new { ... }
  sub foobar { ... }
  sub bar { ... }

  package main;

  my $object = Your::Class->new;
  $object->foo(); # This calls Some::Role::foo()
  $object->bar(); # This calls Your::Class::bar()
  $object->foobar(); # This calls Your::Class::foobar()
  
  if ( Your::Class->does( 'Some::Role' ) ) {
      # This will evaluate as true
  }

  if ( $object->does( 'Some::Role' ) ) {
      # This will evaluate as true
  }

  Some::Other::Role->apply( $object );

  if ( Your::Class->does( 'Some::Other::Role' ) ) {
      # This will evaluate as false
  }

  if ( $object->does( 'Some::Other::Role' ) ) {
      # This will evaluate as true
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an implementation of current state of Perl6 roles in Perl5. It draws 
very heavily from both the L<Class::Role> and L<Class::Roles> modules, but 
is backwards compatible with neither of them. 

=head1 ROLES

=head2 What is a Role?

Roles are a form of B<behavior> reuse, and can be thought of as a collection 
of methods unassociated with a particular class. Roles are composed into 
classes, at which point the methods in the role are I<flattened> into that 
particular class. 

A valid role is one that inherits directly from Perl6::Roles and does B<not>
inherit from anything else. Other than that, it is just a package with 
methods inside.

=head2 Is attribute composition supported? 

Since Perl (5) provides no consistent way to handle instance attributes, 
it is difficult to code this behavior in a generic way. That is not to say
it is not possible to do this, especially given some kind of consistent 
class/instance structure. However, this is left as an exercise for the reader.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<apply( $class|$object )>

If a $class, this will apply the role (which is the invocant) to the given
class. It will add all the methods within the role that the class doesn't
already have and mark the class as 'does' the role.

If an $object, this will create a new class that inherits from the original
class, apply the role to that new class, and rebless the object into that new
class.

=head2 C<does( $role )>

This method is not actually contained within Perl6::Roles. It is installed in
UNIVERSAL, which is the package that all objects automagically inherit from.
This allows the syntax C<$some_random_object-E<gt>does( 'Some::Role' );>.

This method will return true if the given class or object 'does' the given
role and false otherwise.

B<Note:> A class does itself and all its parents. An object does its class and
all of its parent classes.

=head1 CODE COVERAGE

We use L<Devel::Cover> to test the code coverage of our tests. Below is the
L<Devel::Cover> report on this module's test suite.

This code is based very heavily upon both L<Class::Role> (written by Luke
Palmer) and L<Class::Roles> (written by chromatic).
